Data visualization consists of presenting information and data graphically to synthesizing complex information and understanding patterns and exceptions presented in the data. Data visualization should not be used as decoration.

### Line chart

Used to show trends over time and for comparing data series. It shows values at points connected by lines as continuous data.

#### Variation: Area chart

Show the same information as the line graph, only presenting it graphically.

### Bar chart

Uses bars to compare discrete, categorical data or to compare trends. Display bars vertically and corresponds to your numeric value measurement.

### Column chart

In charts that are measured on nominal (qualitative) scales, display the bars in the horizontal position. This facilitates a quick view of categories, which can be identified next to or inside each bar.

### Stacked chart

Used to compare the contribution ratio to the total value within a scale.

### Pie chart

Used to show a part-to-whole visualization. By comparing data through angles, pie charts are not usually the easiest options for analyzing quantitative data (consider using Bar Chart or Column Chart). Pay attention to the number of items, as these charts do not accommodate large numbers of categories.

### Control chart

Control charts are used in processes to track the evolution of a variable against one or more value references.
