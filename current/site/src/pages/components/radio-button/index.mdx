# Radio Button

Used when a list of two or more options are mutually exclusive, meaning the user must select only one option.

## Best practices

- The options must be grouped together with a label.
- An option must be selected by default. **Except** when a default option can cause harm to the user or implies a critical/important action of the system: in these cases, you can present the list without any default option and add an option to clear the selection.
- Order the list in a logical order, for example: most likely to be selected first/ least likely last; simplest option to the most complex, etc.
- For a list with more than 4 options consider using [Select](/components/select).
