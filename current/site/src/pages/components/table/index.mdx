# Table

The component presents data distributed in lines and columns, displaying them in a logical order that allows easy reading, comparison and scan of the information.

## Best practices

- Columns where ordinating is possible, should present the sort icon in the right side of the label.
- The [Paginator](/components/paginator) component must be presented only for large data sets.

## Data table

A table that automatically generates rows based on `columns` prop and gives support to sorting and loading state.
