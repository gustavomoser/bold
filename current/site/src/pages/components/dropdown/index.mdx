# Dropdown

Used to reveal a list of hidden options or commands. In the header, it’s usually used for navigation, where one action takes the user to another page.

## Best practices

- Don’t remove items from the list if this action is not available. In this case, keep the item disabled.
- Don’t put many items on the list. If you need more options, consider using another type of header/menu.

## Example

<Demo src='pages/components/dropdown/DropdownExample' />
