# Tabs

Tabs are used to quickly navigate between views within the same context, allowing a user to access different contents without leaving the page.

## Best practices

- Labels are concise and use one to two words maximum.
- Use Tabs when the content and structure of the pages are different.
- A maximum of six tabs may be displayed. This is to maintain an uncluttered UI and reduce cognitive load for users.
- Tabs with related content should be grouped adjacent to each other.
- It's not recommended to use Tabs as filters.
