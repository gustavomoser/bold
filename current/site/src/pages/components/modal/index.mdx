# Modal

Modals are used to display content in a layer above the app. It's used in cases when you need to view, create or edit content as well as confirmation messages. No other information on the main page should be accessed while a modal is active.

## Best practices

- Use modals sparingly because they interrupt user workflow.
- The title should reflect the action or button that was clicked by the user.
- Should be dismissed by pressing ESC key, clicking/touching outside the modal area and by using the "x" icon in the upper right corner of the modal.
- Maintain users previous focused element after closing the modal.

## Modal types

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width={160}>Information</th>
      <td>
        Used to display information that does not require user input. They usually display only text that does not need
        to be displayed directly on the screen.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Confirmation</th>
      <td>
        Used to validate decisions or to obtain a second confirmation from the user. Usually, require "yes" or "no"
        answers.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Input</th>
      <td>Used to receive data and they usually include input areas that the user can interact with.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
