# Stepper

Stepper is a visual representation of user progress through a set of steps. They guide the user through a number of steps in order to complete a specified process, generally a wizard.

## Best practices

- Display the steps sequentially in order from left to right.
- Allow the user to return to a previous step to review their data submission.
- When possible, use some indication of the status of the step, like when it's complete/validated, or incomplete/invalidated.

## Step status

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width={160}>Completed</th>
      <td>Presented when users achieve the minimum required to continue to the next step.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Active</th>
      <td>Presented when the step is currently active and not validated yet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Incompleted</th>
      <td>Steps not reached yet.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Examples

### Manually controlled state

The state of the stepper is manually controlled via `Step` component props.

### Controling state with `useStepperState` hook

Optionally, the hook `useStepperState` can be used to control the stepper state.
