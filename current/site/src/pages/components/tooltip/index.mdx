# Tooltip

Tooltips provide additional information upon hover or focus. They often contain helper text that is contextual to an element. Tooltips do not receive input focus.

## Best practices

- They should contain read-only text. The use of interactive elements, such as Buttons or Links is discouraged.
- The position must be flexible and change depending on how close the element is to the edge of the screen.
