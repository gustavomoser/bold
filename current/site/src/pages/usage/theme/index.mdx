# Theme

Bold exports two theme objects: `lightTheme` and `darkTheme`, using the former as default.

You can switch this site documentation theme between light/dark by using the light bulb icon on the top right corner of the page.

## Customizing the theme

The theme can be changed using the `ThemeProvider` component:

<Demo src='pages/usage/theme/Customize' />

## Accessing the current theme variable

Use the `useTheme` or `useStyles` hooks to access the theme variable:

<Demo src='pages/usage/theme/AccessTheme' />

## Custom themes

Create a custom theme using the `createTheme` function.

<Demo src='pages/usage/theme/CustomTheme' />
