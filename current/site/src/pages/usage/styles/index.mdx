# Styles

Bold uses CSS-in-JS to style its components, so all the CSS is bundled together with the JS file and attached to the DOM at execution time. We use [emotion](https://emotion.sh), a CSS-in-JS library, to acomplish that.

## Styling with `useStyles` hook

The `useStyles` function is a [React hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that can be used to generate CSS stylesheets and inject to custom components. It returns an object containing:

- `classes`: A map containing the generated classes, to be used as `className` of your components
- `css`: The emotion's `css` function which is used to generate the classes
- `theme`: The current bold theme

### Using `css` function

You can also use the `css` function to create stylesheets:
