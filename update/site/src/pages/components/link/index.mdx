# Link

Links are used primarily as a navigational element. Links may also change what or how data is displayed (E.g.: view more, show all).

## Best practices

- Links should be one word or short phrases.
- Text should be consistent with the title of the intended destination. Avoid labels like "Click here", "Here".
- If the action taken by the user will change or manipulate data, use a [Button](/components/button).
