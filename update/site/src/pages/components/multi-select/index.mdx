# Multi Select

Use the multi-select component to select more than 1 item from a list. The list usually contains 5 or more items. It allows to search and shows the items that have already been selected or select all items at once.

## Best practices

- Order the list by frequency of use, and if applicable, in ascending order.
- If the list shows less than 5 items, consider displaying directly on the screen, using the [Checkbox](/components/checkbox) component.
- Whenever possible group the options and use short labels to describe the content (E.g.: In a food combo, the options can be grouped by: Vegetable, fruits, etc.)
- For a situation where the user can select only one option, use [Select](/components/select) or [Radio Button](/components/radio-button).
