# Search

Search enables users to specify a word or a phrase to find particularly relevant pieces of content without the use of navigation.

**Filter**: Filtering can be used as a way to further narrow down content on the page based on the user's search query. Filtering does not replace Ordination.

## Best practices

- Use labels to show that the results are being displayed. And present the most relevant results first.
- For searches with many results use the Paging component and indicate how many results were found.
- Display clear messages when no results are found and offer other search suggestions whenever possible.
- Keep the original text in the input field. It facilitates the user's action if he wants to make a new search with some modifications in the input.
- If it is possible to detect a typing error, show the results for the word "corrected", this avoids the frustration of not obtaining results and does not force the user to perform a new search.
- Where appropriate, highlight the search terms in the results.
