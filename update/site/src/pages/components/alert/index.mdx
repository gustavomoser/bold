# Alert

The alerts appear on the top of the screen and they display critical information about loss of data, functionality, error, etc.

## Best practices

- Avoid displaying more than one alert at a time and long messages.
- Use notifications to present information that needs to be viewed immediately and that requires user attention.
- Present clear, concise messages and give follow up actions to allow the user to become more informed or resolve the issue.
- Avoid displaying messages with technical error codes that do not help the user solve the problem.
- Present specific messages to each situation instead of using standard messages.
- Take the blame when it's appropriate. Say "we're having trouble connecting" rather than "you're having connection issues".

## Alert types

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width={160}>Information</th>
      <td>
        Blue color. The default notification is usually used to give information that doesn't require too much attention
        or action. They are typically not in response to a user action. (E.g.: "Logged in as Jo√£o da Silva. Logout.")
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Danger</th>
      <td>
        Red color. Shows to the user that some process or task cannot be completed. Error messages should be clear and
        objective, avoiding presenting technical error codes. Whenever possible should present a solution or link
        indicating the next step. (E.g.: "The last item could not be added. Please refresh the page.")
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Warning</th>
      <td>
        Orange color. They are usually in anticipation of a significant change. Clearly communicate what will happen if
        the user proceed with the action and provide an alternative where possible. (E.g.: "Your license is about to
        expire. Please renew your license by August 5, 2019.")
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Success</th>
      <td>Green color. Provides a positive response to user actions. (E.g.: "Professional added successfully.")</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
