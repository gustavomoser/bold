# Date picker

Date components allow the user to make a specific selection through a visual calendar. By default, the calendar always displays the current month or year. If you already have a date entered, the calendar displays the month or year for that date.

## Best practices

- The field must allow the user to also enter the value through keyboard input.
- The field should have only one input type, and should not be divided into fields for each information (day, month, year).

### Date Range Picker

- Use when the date selected is close to the actual date or for a period of less than 1 year.
- Use placeholders to indicate the format of the data entry, for example: dd/mm/yyyy or mm/dd/yy, etc..

### Week Range Picker

- Use if the selected periods must start on a Sunday and end on a Saturday.
- If this component receives a date range in it's value prop, it must be a week, for example: 05/02/2021 (Sunday) to 05/08/2021 (Saturday). Otherwise, it will not be selected. An example of a invalid entry: 05/03/2021 (Monday) to 05/05/2021 (Wednesday).

### Month Range Picker

- Use when the selected period must be at least an entire month.
- If the user should select a period with greater granularity, such as weeks or days, use the above components.
