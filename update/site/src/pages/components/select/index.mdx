# Select

Select is a type of input that is used in forms, where a user is submitting data and chooses one option from a list. When text is inserted on the input field, filter the options. Consider showing suggestions when the select is active.

## Best practices

- Order the list by frequency of use, and if applicable, in ascending order.
- For situations where the user can select more than one option, use using [Multi Select](/components/multi-select).
- Avoid using the select input of data that is known to the user, such as birth dates.

## Example

<Demo src='pages/components/select/Select' />

## Suggestion

Allow select value to be whatever the user types, by providing a `createNewItem` prop.

You can use the prop `openOnFocus` to control whether the suggestion menu should appear when input receives focus - default is false for suggestion selects (when createNewItem) and true for normal selects.
