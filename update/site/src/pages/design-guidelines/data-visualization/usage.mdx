## Which chart to use

The type of chart you use depends primarily on two things: the data you want to communicate, and what you want to convey about that data. These guidelines provide descriptions of various different types of charts and their use cases.

### Comparison

Compare data between multiple distinct categories.

### Change over time

Show data over a period of time, such as trends or comparisons across multiple categories.

### Relationship & Distribution

Show the relationship between two or more variables or the frequency at which data occurs.

### Part-to-whole

Show how partial elements add up to a total.

## Dashboards

### Operational dashboard

Use it to provide information that demands immediate user action and time-sensitive data, such as data monitoring. This kind of dashboard is constantly updating.

### Analytical dashboard

Use analytical dashboards to help users take future actions, investigate or analyze data. It updates less frequently than the operational dashboard (eg: 1 time a day). Learn more about dashboard types at [Nielsen and Norman group website](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dashboards-preattentive/).
